Simpliest way to assure transparency while administrating friends computer online via ssh
using 'script' and organized script files.

 - Edit termlog.sh to define your own friend's path DESTDIR
 - Add it to your own bashrc
 - Give him/her the command to use to see :

	$ scriptreplay $DESTDIR/user_date-time.*
